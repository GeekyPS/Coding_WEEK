# Open Source Task (Coding Week)
## @CodingClubiitg
### My name is Priyanshu, and I am a EEE Fresher(B.Tech 21-25) at IITG. My 
### Roll No. is 210108035. I am a tech Enthusiast and loves to Code. My other 
### hobbies include Listening to Music
### and so much more to say about me but I have to keep it brief 
#### So Bye..!

I want to contribute to the open source , as it helps me to showcase my 
ideas and coding skills to my peers and other developers and help me 
rectify my mistakes and errors by recieving feedback on my changes made, 
so overall its a great learning experience

Also, at times i myself need a piece of code to work upon , this is where 
the open source community comes to rescue , and if u take something u have 
to give something back
